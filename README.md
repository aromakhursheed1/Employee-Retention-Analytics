# Employee-Retention-Analytics
This project explores the factors influencing employee attrition in a company with a 15% turnover rate, employing machine learning models such as logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests to predict attrition. The insights help drive policy formulation, strategic HR interventions, and optimised training and compensation strategies.
